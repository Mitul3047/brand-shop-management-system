There are six cards on the project's main page. Upon selecting a card, you will be sent to the product page where a slider and many cards pulled from a database are displayed.

Since the "Add Product" page is a private area, you must finish the registration and login procedures before adding a product.

There are two buttons on the cards of the slider page that allow you to update product data.

By selecting the "Details" option, you may reach the detailed route; however, keep in mind that only logged-in users are able to view it since it is a private route. You can add things to your cart in the details path, and they will be kept on the "My Cart" page.

You can delete goods from your cart page.# brand-shop-management-system
